## Data Collection
src/data-preprocessing

API requests to receive all current locations of bikes from nextbike, lidlbike and mobike in Berlin (inner circle) and store them into a single database.

Add config.py file to src/ with API Keys for Deutsche Bahn API (https://developer.deutschebahn.com/store/) and database credentials.

For access to lime bike API insert phone_no to config.py and follow steps in lime_access.py (three manual steps required).
